This code is primarily the work of Tucker Trainor, a student researcher in the Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, under the supervision of Dr. Adam J. Lee and Dr. Panos K. Chrysanthis, both of the Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh. Certain Java source code was adapted from original code by Dr. Lee as noted in the comments of those files. Tcl/Expect scripts used for remotely configuring and running servers are based on a template provided by Robert B. Hoffman, also of the Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh.

The code was written in 2012 for Java SE 6, and is untested on more recent versions of Java. The authors no longer support this code.
