# PROOF proof - DEFERRED, PUNCTUAL, INCREMENTAL, CONTINUOUS
PROOF DEFERRED
# VM validationMode - integer for setting mode of proof
#
# Deferred/Punctual 0: 2PC only
# Deferred/Punctual 1: view consistency single chance
# Deferred/Punctual 2: view consistency second chance
# Deferred/Punctual 3: global consistency coordinator calls policy server
# Deferred/Punctual 4: global consistency any participant can call policy server
#
# Incremental 0: 2PC only (use PUSH 0, this may not be coded thoroughly)
# Incremental 1: TXN: view consistency PTC: global single chance
# Incremental 2: TXN: view consistency PTC: global second chance
# Incremental 3: TXN: global consistency PTC: global single chance
# Incremental 4: TXN: global consistency PTC: global second chance
#
# Continuous 1: View consistency (2PC for commit)
# Continuous 2: Global consistency (2PVC for commit)

# PUSH policyPush
# Deferred/Punctual - 0: No push  1: Push
# Incremental - 0: No push  1: During operations  2: At PTC time
# Continuous - 0: No push  1: Single push to random server; 2: Push for each
# join (up to PTC); 3: push when entering commit phase (global consistency)
